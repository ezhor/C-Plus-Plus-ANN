# rANNcor
rANNcor (recursively stands for *rANNcor Artificial Neural Network Core*) is a strongly object oriented implementation of a deep learning neural network in C++.

This is an improved version of [my deep learning neural network implemented in Java](https://github.com/ezhor/JavaANN).

Essentially it improves its design and performance.
It also adds a bit more functionality. (In progress)
